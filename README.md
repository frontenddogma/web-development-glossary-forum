# The Web Development Glossary Forum

This is the makeshift forum for the [living](https://meiert.com/blog/living-websites-living-books/) _The Web Development Glossary_ books as well as the glossary website, [WebGlossary.info](https://webglossary.info/), which explain and define thousands of web development terms.

Use the forum to [report issues and make suggestions](https://github.com/frontenddogma/web-development-glossary-forum/issues/new). (Thank you!)

(Learn a web development term a day on [Mastodon](https://techhub.social/@webglossary) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/webglossary.info) 💡)

## Stats

These are the book counts. The website goes by distinct entries (pages), where, given the same manuscript versions, it’s the overall number of _meanings_ that corresponds with the number of terms presented here. (It has felt more natural to speak of “terms” in the book, and of “entries” on the website.)
